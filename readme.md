some codes about


###information theory
    - SimpleOnecodeHuffman: Fastest Huffman Code (:p).
    - Simplest_Huffman: First implementation of huffman code (non-contextual non-adaptive), compressor generate huffman.map, decompressor use huffman.map.
    - Huffman_ANCDec: Huffman variation (Adaptive, Non-contextual, Decrement). 
    - Huffman_ANCDecIMPROVED: Improve: Change huffman tree with sqrt(n) steps.
