some codes about


### information theory
    - SimpleOnecodeHuffman: Fastest Huffman Code (:p).
    - Simplest_Huffman: First implementation of huffman code (non-contextual non-adaptive), compressor generate huffman.map, decompressor use huffman.map.
    - Huffman_ANCDec: Huffman variation (Adaptive, Non-contextual, Decrement). 
    - Huffman_ANCDec(IMPROVED): Change huffman tree with sqrt(n) steps.
    - Huffman_SACO1: Huffman semi-adaptive, contextual, order 1.
    - BWT: Burrows-Wheeler-Transform (and inverse) - working but can be improve
    - MTF: Simplest Move to Front algorithm using Lists 
    - PPMC_Arithmetic: Implementation by bob-carpenter (original: github.com/bob-carpenter/java-arithcode)
